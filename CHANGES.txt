1.0.1 -> 1.0.2

- @ApplicationService annotation will not use @Transactional anymore.

  You have to add @Transactional yourself, where it will be really needed - not all application services require
  to be transactional.

- Command i-face has been removed; CommandHandler will handle commands of any type, and not require
  Command i-face to be implemented by them

- ApplicationService annotation has been moved to stereotype package, original service package has been removed

- Dependencies update: Spring Framework version 3.2.2 will be used; org.springframework:spring-tx dependency
  not needed now
