1.0.1 -> 1.0.2

- @ApplicationService annotation will not use @Transactional anymore.

  You have to add @Transactional yourself, where it will be really needed - not all application services require
  to be transactional.

- Command is deprecated starting from 1.0.2; CommandHandler will handle commands of any type, and not require
  Command i-face to be implemented by them
